# Mathematics for ML, Third Winter School in AI in Kathmandu, Nepal
I prepared this code for the Lab session in Third Winter School in AI (Dec 20-30, 2021) held in Kathmandu, Nepal.

My code is based on the book Mathematics for ML, and its companion webpage

## Requirements
You can simply run it in colab
If you want to run it in your machine, the requirements are pretty basic like numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. 
I have also included a .yml file which you can use with conda to create a new environment and run locally in your machine.
